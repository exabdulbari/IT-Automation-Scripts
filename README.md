# IT Automation Scripts

This repository contains simple PowerShell scripts I created to practice automating common IT tasks. 
These scripts help me understand how to perform basic system maintenance and troubleshooting more efficiently.

## Scripts Included

### 1. DiskCheck.ps1
- Checks free disk space on all drives.
- Helps monitor storage and ensures drives are not full.
- Example usage: Run in PowerShell as Administrator and see free vs total space for each drive.

### 2. TempCleaner.ps1
- Cleans temporary files from Windows and user temp folders.
- Helps free up space and remove unnecessary files.
- Example usage: Run the script in PowerShell to automatically remove temp files.

### 3. NetworkPingReport.ps1
- Pings multiple devices on a local network to check connectivity.
- Helps identify unreachable devices or network issues.
- Example usage: Run in PowerShell and get a simple report of reachable/unreachable IPs.

## How I Use This Repo

- I test them in my home lab or virtual machines and document the results.
- I plan to add more scripts as I learn new automation techniques.

## Notes
- Scripts are beginner-friendly and safe to run.
- All scripts include comments to explain what each part does.
- The goal is to demonstrate my practical IT skills and my ability to learn scripting for IT support tasks.
